# Health Assured – Frontend Tech Task

This project is my submission for the Health Assured frontend developer task.  
It demonstrates use of **React, TypeScript, TDD, and modern best practices**.

## 🚀 Features

- Display resources grouped by category

- Resource details in a modal (click a card to open)

- Filter by title or tags

- Fully tested with TDD (unit + integration)

## 🧪 Tests

Run tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

## 📝 Notes

If I had more time, I would:
- Implement sorting by category/date

- Enhance styles and visual polish (animations, spacing, consistency)

- Work with a more realistic GitHub workflow (feature branches + pull requests + code reviews) 

- Add end-to-end tests with Cypress or Playwright
